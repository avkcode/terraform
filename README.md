This repository provides Terraform and Docker templates for deploying cloud services with infrastructure-as-code. It includes modular Terraform configurations for provisioning resources, Docker setups for containerized deployments, and supporting scripts for testing and automation. The structure separates infrastructure and application layers, supporting multiple environments with SSL/TLS configuration. Designed for cloud-native applications, it demonstrates IaC best practices for secure, scalable deployments.
